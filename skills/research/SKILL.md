# research

GitHub-integrated wrapper around `quaere-evidence`. Drives the Finding → Hypothesis → Defense → Probe → Decision workflow with parallel subagents and posts the resulting plan to GitHub. Do NOT write any production code in this skill.

**Issue / task:** $ARGUMENTS

## Step 0 — Determine issue context

Check whether `$ARGUMENTS` is a number (existing issue) or free text (new task).

- **Number** → `gh issue view $ARGUMENTS` and proceed with that issue.
- **Free text** → use the text as the task description; an issue will be created in Step 5.

## Step 1 — Read issue/task and form hypotheses

1. If existing issue, read it with `gh issue view`. Otherwise use the free text.

2. Skim the project layout (directory tree, CLAUDE.md, key entry points). Do NOT deep-read files yet.

3. **Establish baselines.**

   - **Test baseline**: build and run existing tests. Record pre-existing failures so later regressions can be distinguished.
   - **Memory recall baseline**: read `MEMORY.md` (index only); for each entry whose one-line description plausibly intersects the work, open and read it. A hypothesis that contradicts an active memory rule is rejected at formation.

4. Form hypotheses across three aspects:

   - **What needs to change**: required code modifications
   - **What invariants must hold**: contracts / preconditions / correctness properties
   - **What could break**: existing code paths affected by the change, especially where new inputs flow through existing APIs

5. Each hypothesis is phrased as a **falsifiable Review Claim or Hypothesis** in the `quaere-evidence` sense — concrete enough that a subagent can attempt to disprove it.

6. **Tag each hypothesis with a `kind`:**

   - `empirical` — resolved by reading code, running tests, observing runtime, inspecting git history, querying spec / external API / caller behavior. Subagent probes in Step 2 handle these.
   - `derivational` — resolved by deductive reasoning from defining equations / type laws / protocol axioms / mathematical or physical first principles. The truth value of a derivational hypothesis does not depend on the state of the codebase; reading more code will not resolve it. Step 2 handles these in the main context, not via subagents.

   Disambiguation test: "if the codebase did not exist, would the claim still have a definite truth value?" Yes → derivational. No → empirical. Two follow-on rules:

   - **Numerical verification stays derivational.** "Construct a candidate → check against an oracle (spec, reference value, closed-form ground truth)" is derivational; resolve in Step 2.B with a scratch script outside the project tree.
   - **Misclassification signal.** If a probe's action is "write code in the project, then check whether it works", it is a derivational gap dressed as an empirical probe — re-classify before the plan exits research.

7. **Specific-example claim sweep (REQUIRED when applicable).** If the plan attaches deductive properties to a concrete example ("this example is symmetric / non-degenerate / exercises the multi-X path"), each property MUST be a separate `derivational` hypothesis — "obvious" is not an exemption. Form: "Example E has property P, derivable from E's defining equations / specification."

8. **Present hypotheses to the user for approval before spawning subagents.** Show the `kind` tag for each. The user can narrow scope, split into sub-issues, or correct mis-classifications.

## Step 2 — Verify hypotheses

Hypotheses split by `kind`. Empirical hypotheses go through subagent probes (Step 2.A). Derivational hypotheses are resolved in the main context (Step 2.B). Both must complete before Step 3 consolidates.

### Step 2.A — Empirical hypotheses (subagents under quaere-evidence)

Spawn one subagent per `empirical` hypothesis (or per small related group). Each subagent operates under the `quaere-evidence` skill and follows its workflow exactly.

Subagent contract:

1. **Run `quaere-evidence`** with the assigned hypothesis as the initial Review Claim or Hypothesis.
2. **Probes (per `quaere-evidence` §5) are three-way: Supporting / Disconfirming / Scope.** The Disconfirming probe **must be actually executed**, not just listed.
3. **For non-trivial existing code, read at `quaere-semantic` depth** (its `What / Why / Invariants / Failure / Connections` schema with the UNKNOWN-probe discipline). Shallow grep-only verification is permitted only for trivially mechanical hypotheses (existence checks, file locations).
4. **Runtime probe (preferred for behavioral claims).** Behavioral claims (output ordering, return shape, error-path return, ABI / FFI layout, signal handling, performance) need a minimal reproducer — docs reading is corroboration, not verification. Boundary cases (minimal/maximal sizes, type variations, single-element containers) belong here.
5. **Caller-contract verification for change-impact hypotheses.** Classify the change as compile-breaking (new required trait method, type change) or silently semantic (same signature, different behavior). Semantic changes need caller-by-caller verification. Flag any public API with unchecked internal assumptions (pointer arithmetic trusting an offset, a serializer trusting field order, an index trusting contiguity).
6. Return a **Decision** in the four-state shape from `quaere-evidence` §6 (`confirmed` / `rejected` / `inconclusive` / `deferred`). For `inconclusive`, attach the remaining `probe:`. For `deferred`, attach reason and resolution-point.
7. Report back with concise file paths, line numbers, function signatures, and probe results.

**Subagent granularity**: hypotheses requiring only existence checks or single-file grep can be resolved directly from the main context. Reserve subagents for hypotheses that touch multiple files or need deep reading. Spawn all empirical-hypothesis subagents in a single message; each owns its own `quaere-evidence` ledger.

### Step 2.B — Derivational hypotheses (deductive verification in main context)

Each `derivational` hypothesis is resolved by working out the deduction explicitly, not by reading code. The deduction may take either form:

- **Symbolic** — pen-and-paper algebra / type-law rewriting / protocol-axiom application.
- **Numerical** — when the closed form is too messy, reduce to a numerical identity against an oracle (published reference matrix, closed-form spec, ground-truth value); run a scratch script outside the project tree. This **is** the derivation, not a deferred implementation probe.

Subagents cannot resolve derivational hypotheses.

For each derivational hypothesis:

1. **State the defining equations / axioms / specification clauses** the example or claim rests on. Quote the source if it is an external spec (RFC, protocol doc, mathematical definition); reproduce it if it is a project-internal definition.
2. **Derive forward from the defining equations to the claimed property.** Show the deductive steps. A derivation that ends in "therefore P holds" without reproducible steps is unacceptable.
3. **Attempt a counterexample (the disconfirming step).** Try to construct an instance of the example where the claimed property fails, working from the defining equations. A property that resists counterexample construction is corroborated; one that admits a counterexample falsifies the hypothesis.
4. **Report a Decision** in the four-state shape from Step 2.A, with these derivational-specific resolutions:
   - `confirmed` — derivation completed AND counterexample construction failed
   - `rejected` — counterexample constructed (the claim is false; plan needs revision before continuing)
   - `inconclusive` — derivation incomplete due to missing axiom / ambiguous spec / convention conflict; attach the missing piece as an empirical `probe:` routing back through Step 2.A. ("Code it up and check at implementation time" is not valid — use the numerical-derivation lane.)
   - `deferred` — outside current scope; attach reason and resolution-point

A `rejected` derivational hypothesis is a **plan bug**. Correct the plan and re-derive before Step 3. A plan that attaches deductive properties to examples without reproducing the derivation fails this step.

## Step 3 — Consolidate into implementation plan

Merge subagent reports into a single plan with the following sections.

### Plan body

- **Checklist of changes** with exact file paths, function signatures, type definitions
- **Impact list**: every caller affected and its implicit contract (for use in implementation verification)
- **Test plan**:
  - Invariants the new/changed code must satisfy
  - Tests to add/modify with expected behavior
  - For new constructors / input paths: tests passing those inputs through every existing public API that could receive them. A new input path without cross-API tests is incomplete.
  - **Surrogate-probe re-instantiation**: every hypothesis confirmed in Step 2 by a *surrogate* probe (proof-of-concept build, reference implementation, toy fixture standing in for the committed artifact) must emit either an artifact-level Test plan entry that re-runs the check against the committed artifact, or an explicit `surrogate evidence suffices because <reason>` line.
- **Implementation guards** (from confirmed hypotheses):
  - New invariants enforced with assertions, not comments
  - Paired APIs that must stay consistent (sibling methods)
  - Constructor validations required
  - State that needs an explicit field rather than heuristic inference
- **Derivations** (from confirmed derivational hypotheses): for each specific example whose properties were claimed in the plan, reproduce the derivation in compressed form (defining equations → steps → conclusion). The plan reader should be able to retrace the deduction without re-running Step 2.B.
- **Conflicts or dependencies between hypotheses** (if any)

### Inconclusive / Deferred items (REQUIRED section)

This section is **mandatory**. It explicitly carries forward UNKNOWNs into the implementation phase so that mid-implementation discoveries are either listed (handled per plan) or surface as research gaps (halt and escalate).

```markdown
## Inconclusive / Deferred items

- inconclusive — <hypothesis>
  probe: <next investigation: git blame, runtime observation, etc.>
  expected branches:
    - if probe yields X → continue per plan
    - if probe yields Y → re-plan trigger (return to research)

- deferred — <hypothesis>
  reason: <why postponed>
  resolution-point: <when this becomes actionable>
```

If none, write `Inconclusive / Deferred items: none identified` explicitly.

### Filter unresolved questions before listing them

Before escalating a sub-decision to the user as "unresolved":

1. **Workspace patterns** — search the workspace (`rg`, `fd`) for analogous constructs. If the workspace consistently does X, that is the answer.
2. **Memory and prior conversation** — check available memory entries and recent turns for decisions on the same axis.
3. **Subagent reports** — re-read Step 2 output. A subagent's confirmed recommendation is resolved unless contradicted elsewhere.

A sub-decision is genuinely unresolved only when the above are silent or contradictory. "More than one technically-viable option exists" is not unresolved — it is analysis you owe the user. When you do escalate, state what you checked.

Report the plan back to the main context.

## Step 3.4 — Reachability check (mandatory)

A plan can be locally closed yet reach further than the author reasoned about — a new public surface whose semantics depend on consumer code outside scope (Checks 1–3), an enablement that binds compilation units the plan never named (Check 4), or a verification probe that covers fewer build configurations than the obligation spans (Check 5). `codex-plan-review` and author confidence both miss these — they require looking outward. Any check firing means the plan's reach is not closed; rescope or defer.

### Check 1 — Dead-on-arrival state

For each new public symbol (parameter with non-trivial value range, struct field, accessor, method, variant), ask: does any current or in-plan code path **branch on** this symbol's value (`match`, `if`, conditional dispatch, layout reorder, validation)? Pure references — `Clone` copying, accessor exposure, constructor storing — are not branches.

- Real branch exists → proceed.
- No real branch → dead-on-arrival. Either expand scope (add consumer-side branching to the checklist) or defer the symbol until the consumer materializes.

### Check 2 — Docstring-vocabulary scan

Grep the plan body and proposed docstrings (case-insensitive):

```
not yet honored | currently restricted | social contract | deferred (mitigation|consumer-side|to a later)
documented limitation | for future use | in preparation for | analogous to ... cascade
in a future PR | follow-up issue tracks | when consumers ... | until consumers ...
```

Each hit admits an out-of-scope dependency. Each must resolve into a `Depends on #N` link (carried in `Inconclusive / Deferred items`), a scope expansion, or a defer / close decision. Hits without a resolution route → return to Step 1 and rescope.

### Check 3 — Local-closure vs contract-closure distinction

Restate the plan's claim in one sentence. Would it still be true if every line of consumer code outside the plan were arbitrary?

- **Local closure**: "constructor stores the data correctly and propagates the order tag" — true regardless of consumers.
- **Contract closure**: "constructor produces a tensor that downstream operations interpret correctly under the declared order" — only true if consumers honor the tag.

If the user-visible value rests on contract closure and contract closure is out of scope, the plan is mis-scoped. Bring contract closure in or step back to the upstream design decision.

### Check 4 — Shared-scope config reach

When the plan enables a lint / setting / config entry at a **shared scope** (Cargo `[workspace.lints]` or package `[lints]`, a workspace / package / global config file, a compiler-wide flag, any setting inherited by more than the one unit being changed), enumerate **every unit the scope mechanically binds** and confirm the intended target matches the actual reach.

For Cargo, a package `[lints]` table — including `[workspace.lints]` inherited via `[lints] workspace = true` — binds every target kind of that package: lib, bins, integration tests, benches, examples, and the build script (`build.rs`). Each is a separate compilation unit, not just the library. (`[workspace.lints]` binds only member packages that opt in with `[lints] workspace = true`.)

- Reach matches intent → proceed.
- Reach exceeds intent (the setting is meant for the library but the scope also binds test / bench / example / build-script units) → resolve one of two ways, never by silent acceptance: (a) narrow the scope to a per-unit attribute (e.g. per-lib `#![deny(...)]`); or (b) bring every bound unit into the Step 3 impact / test plan and verify each satisfies the setting. A bound unit that is neither narrowed out nor verified is an unresolved item, not an accepted one.

### Check 5 — Verification-config representativeness

When the plan's safety rests on a probe — "it builds", "the tests pass", "the cycle compiles" — and the same source is compiled under more than one **non-interchangeable configuration** (Rust `--cfg test` vs the non-test build, a feature-gated vs ungated build, C / C++ translation units compiled with macros that change a type's layout or ODR identity, a distinct `target` / `arch`), a passing probe under one configuration does not certify a sibling. The configurations look interchangeable but can produce distinct type instances / ABIs, so an obligation that binds in configuration B is untouched by a probe that ran configuration A.

Identify the configuration where the **new** obligation binds and confirm the probe exercises THAT configuration:

- Probe runs the binding configuration → proceed.
- Probe runs only a sibling ("does it build", an integration target linking the non-test build, the ungated build) while the obligation binds elsewhere (the crate's own `--cfg test` unit tests, the gated build) → not certified. Name the binding-configuration probe and add it to the Step 3 test plan, or step back to a structure that keeps the obligation inside one configuration.

Output: **clean** (proceed to Step 3.5) or **flagged** (list firings + proposed resolution + surface to user).

## Step 3.5 — Plan review gate (mandatory offer)

After Step 3 produces a plan and before Step 4 collects user approval:

1. **Always offer `codex-plan-review`** — never silently skip. Phrase it as a recommendation, not a question:

   > "Plan ready. Recommend running `/codex-plan-review` before
   > approval; type `skip` to bypass, or anything else to run it."

2. **If review runs**: triage the findings.

   - **Implementation concerns** (algorithm details, error handling, test coverage gaps, naming): patch the plan in place and proceed to the loop gate below.
   - **Premise concerns** (the assumed root cause may be wrong, the described mechanism doesn't match how the code actually fails, a fixture's claimed properties may not hold, an "obvious" derivation is unproven): **return to Step 1**. Do not patch the plan in place — the hypothesis set itself is suspect, and incremental edits perpetuate the bad premise across iterations.

   Distinguishing the two: an implementation concern asks "given the plan's assumptions, is the proposed approach sound?"; a premise concern asks "are the plan's assumptions actually true?". If the reviewer would have given a different answer with empirical evidence in hand, it's a premise concern.

3. **Loop gate**: after patching, re-run `codex-plan-review` per its Step 4 re-run rule. Exit the loop when the last valid verdict is `approve` or `approve with conditions`. Cap: 3 iterations within the same premise. If the cap is reached, or if the loop sits at `reject` with no further re-run warranted, surface the verdict and outstanding findings to the user and ask whether to proceed as-is, patch further manually, or escalate. Premise concerns return to Step 1 and reset the counter — iteration count is per-premise, not lifetime.

4. **The plan that exits this step is the contract.** Step 5 will post that plan once. Revisions happen here, before posting; there is no "post then revise" loop.

## Step 4 — User approval

Present the plan (after any Step 3.5 revisions) and ask for approval before posting to GitHub.

## Step 5 — Post plan to GitHub

### 5.0 Laundering pass — run `gh-body-check` (MANDATORY)

Run `gh-body-check` on the plan body before any `gh-post` invocation; resolve any ⚠ before posting.

### 5.1 Route to the correct surface

After 5.0 clears, route the plan based on what `$ARGUMENTS` resolves to:

- **Existing single-scope issue** → `gh-post issue comment $ARGUMENTS` (per `file-issue` step 5) with the plan as body.
- **Existing umbrella issue** (the body contains a Phases table or sub-tasks list) → spawn a new sub-issue whose body IS the plan, following `file-issue`'s `Variants > Umbrella sub-issue` shape: `Parent: #<umbrella>` on the first line, `Phase N: <topic>` title, Goal / Scope / Out of scope / Acceptance derived from the plan. After creation, append the new sub-issue's number to the umbrella's Phases table row. Do not also post the plan as an umbrella comment.
- **New task** → `gh-post issue create` (per `file-issue` step 5) with the plan in the body; report the new issue number.

When ambiguous, ask the user. Umbrella sub-issue is the D1 default.

**Issue creation rules** (research-specific; body shape and the language / reference / line-number / exclusion rules come from `gh-body-conventions` via `file-issue`):

1. **Split issues by commit unit.** Each issue corresponds to one atomic, independently committable change. Multi-commit plans become multiple issues with `Depends on #N` links.
2. **No "rejected alternatives" sections** unless explicitly requested.
