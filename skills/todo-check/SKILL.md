# Todo-Check

Forward-looking preflight against the current scope. Item definitions live in `quality-list`; this skill is the **runner**. Update `quality-list`, not this file, when adding or modifying items.

`done-check` asks: "Did the diff satisfy item N?" `todo-check` asks: "What does item N require us to set up so the diff will satisfy it?"

## Procedure

0. **Resolve the active rule set.**

   The base rule set lives in `quality-list/SKILL.md`. Language-specific addenda live alongside it as `quality-list/lang-<language>.md` and supplement the base rules with triggers, mitigation idioms, and mechanical detection patterns for the language. Items themselves stay language-neutral in the base file; addenda only realize them concretely.

   Detection order for the project language:

   1. Check the project's `CLAUDE.md` (or equivalent contributor / agent-guidance file) for a `Language:` declaration line (e.g., `Language: cpp`). If present, load `quality-list/lang-<value>.md`.
   2. Otherwise, auto-detect from file extensions present in the scope (or the work's likely-touched files): `.cpp` / `.cc` / `.cxx` / `.h` / `.hpp` / `.hh` → `cpp`; `.rs` → `rust`; `.py` → `python`; `.ts` / `.tsx` → `typescript`; `.go` → `go`; etc.
   3. Multi-language projects: load every matching `lang-*.md` (one per language present).

   If a detected language has no `lang-<lang>.md`, fall back to the base rules only. Missing addenda are not a concern — they just mean no curated language realizations exist yet.

   The active rule set = base items plus, for each item with content in the loaded addendum, that addendum's section. The preflight framing in Step 2 considers both.

1. **Identify the work scope.** Pull from the plan if one exists, otherwise from the current task description. Determine:

   - What files / modules will change
   - What public symbols, schemas, or contracts will move
   - What invariants the change introduces or modifies
   - Whether a research plan with `Inconclusive / Deferred items` exists (relevant to `discovery-surfacing`)

2. **Process every item in preflight mode.** Read `quality-list/SKILL.md`'s Items index to get the authoritative item set, and process every item in it. Use the per-item Preflight framing quick reference below as the compressed lens — an accelerator over that index spine, not the authoritative set. When an index item has no quick-reference entry, Read its `quality-list/items/<slug>.md` as a safe fallback, so a missing entry never silently drops the item. Read the index for the item set (the slugs); do **not** read the item bodies into main context up front. Only Read a specific `quality-list/items/<slug>.md` file when (a) the item is absent from the quick reference, (b) the quick reference is insufficient to decide active vs N/A, or (c) the item is △ active and the setup action needs the full concern conditions / N/A criteria.

   For each item, determine one of:

   - **△ active — set up needed**: this item will apply to the finished diff; record what to set up *now* so the audit will pass later. Output the concrete preflight action (test fixture variants to include, guard locations to plan, paired-artifact surfaces to update, probes to thread through, etc.).
   - **⊘ N/A**: the item's own N/A criterion already excludes the scope. State why.
   - **? unknown**: cannot decide without more reading; record what would need to be checked to decide.

3. Resolve every **?** before declaring preflight done — either promote to △ with a concrete setup action, or downgrade to ⊘ with a reason.

4. Report the preflight table. Hand the △ rows to the implementation step as setup actions.

## Preflight framing per item (quick reference)

These are how each `quality-list` item reads in preflight mode — a compressed accelerator over the index spine (Step 2), not the authoritative set. The authoritative rule for each item is in `quality-list/items/<slug>.md`, and the authoritative item set is the `quality-list/SKILL.md` index; this is just the lens shift.

- **`invariant-derivation`** — Before patching, derive the full necessary-and-sufficient condition from first principles. List it in the plan.
- **`purpose-verification`** — Identify the input that exposes the purpose end-to-end. Plan to exercise it before declaring done.
- **`pattern-audit`** — If you intend to copy a pattern from a sibling, plan to re-derive its correctness in the current context before reusing it.
- **`scope-discipline`** — Resolve to evaluate findings on their merits, not narrowed to the originating task.
- **`behavior-coverage`** — Design fixtures with the smallest non-trivial parameters per axis. For each parameter, ask "is this the trivial case?" If so, plan a non-trivial variant. Plan happy + error path coverage; plan generic helpers for type-parametric semantics. For tensor-network code, plan ≥3 sites so a bulk tensor is exercised. If a unit will change how a serialized / persisted value is encoded, written, or parsed (not a rename), plan a case per value class the field's type admits (the item body enumerates the classes per type) — a full round-trip, or a one-sided emit / parse case when the counterpart is external — or record why a class is unreachable.
- **`implementation-guards`** — Plan `assert!` locations for new invariants, sibling-method consistency reviews (including any new entry that mirrors an existing sibling — replicate the reference sibling's full input-validation set), constructor validations, and validation ordering (place input validation before any panic-prone operation that assumes the validated precondition).
- **`impact-verification`** — Build the impact list now, before editing. Trace public-symbol callers if no formal list exists. If a unit will make a value class newly reachable or unreachable in a symbol's returns (with or without a signature change), or make a same-signature shift of its element ordering or evaluation timing, or add / remove / reorder / relayer a material side effect or change result identity (add / remove memoization, or swap a shared-vs-copy return) — plan the consumer trace now (the item body defines the classes, the diff-visible evidence forms, and two trace bounds: the return-value trace — direct consumers plus one pass-through hop — for value-class / ordering / timing shifts, and the observer-bound trace — call-site reliance plus distant observers keyed by state surface, after a trace-independent materiality gate — for side-effect / result-identity shifts). If a unit will swap a parsing / decoding / conversion primitive for another (with or without a signature change), plan to state the accepted-domain symmetric difference (value classes and representation forms) and, for narrowing, trace upstream producers' actually-emitted classes and forms against what the new primitive newly rejects; for widening, trace consumers relying on the old rejection (error / validation / fallback). This is the input-side dual of the value-class shift, traced to producers not callers.
- **`test-execution`** — Plan which test commands will be run, and capture the pre-existing failure baseline before any edit. If the diff will touch build-system / packaging / dependency-fetch surfaces, plan an isolated clean-checkout verification run before the PR — once the change is committed, build it from a fresh `git worktree` or local clone with caches and relevant env unset (a worktree / clone sees committed content only, isolating the build from working-tree state).
- **`completion-hygiene`** — Plan which lint / format / type-check / build commands will be run. Note any debug artifacts to strip.
- **`architectural-boundary`** — Identify any new imports / dep edges / `pub` widenings the change will introduce; plan to check them against the project's boundary rules.
- **`escape-hatch-necessity`** — If a unit will introduce a workaround — a static-guarantee escape hatch (Rust `unsafe`, C++ `reinterpret_cast` / `const_cast` / C-style cast, TS `any` / `as` / non-null `!` / `@ts-ignore`), a sleep for a readiness signal, a retry over a race, or any other workaround class covered by the item — plan to derive its necessity first: confirm no direct fix removes the problem. Treat the workaround as a last resort behind that derivation, not a default; a justification comment argues soundness, not necessity.
- **`paired-artifact-drift`** — List every textual surface that will need updating: same-crate `rg` targets, parent module docstrings, `examples/`, `bench/`, doctests, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, migrations / schemas, declared cross-repo paired artifacts. Plan the sweep before editing primary identifiers. If a unit will **narrow the regime in which an already-documented behavior holds** — adding a condition, exception, limitation, or caveat ("not always", "only when", "degrades when", a new `# Panics` / `# Errors` clause, a newly documented failure mode) — list now every other statement of that same behavior per the item's **Qualification completeness** sweep — code docs (module / type / method / field / variant comments), prose surfaces, and declared cross-repo paired artifacts alike, **including statements the unit will not touch**, and plan to re-read each against the qualification, asking whether it needs that qualification rather than whether it is false. A claim-vs-code check will not surface the stranded ones: it examines only the text the unit touches.
- **`docstring-drift`** — If a unit will change behavior without renaming the identifier (delegating to a library, shifting return shape, adding / removing side effects, restructuring control flow), list now the docstring / comment / README claim surfaces that describe the changed code; plan a cold-read re-verification of each against the new behavior, with an execution probe where the behavior becomes library-owned. If a unit will **widen a reachable outcome set** feeding a documented closed enumeration (an error-variant list, "returns one of", a status-code list, a handled-event list), plan now to list the enumeration docs on the affected entry point **and any sibling whose body can actually reach the new member** (not every sibling that merely returns the same type), and update each to include the new member (or record the deliberate omission).
- **`discovery-surfacing`** — If a plan exists, extract its `Inconclusive` items into a watch list. During implementation, any unexpected fact must match a watch-list branch or trigger halt.
- **`ported-code-attribution`** — If any unit's research surfaced an external implementation as a reference, plan the attribution surface (in-source comment block citing project / file / URL / copyright / license, or a top-level `THIRD_PARTY.md`) before the port lands.
- **`signature-change-regression`** — If a unit changes the signature of a function whose call sites live outside its own translation unit (parameter removal / reorder / type substitution), plan one of: (a) a `= delete;` sentinel overload for the old signature shape, (b) a strong typedef over the affected parameter(s) so the implicit-conversion edge is structurally absent, or (c) an exhaustive call-site sweep across the project (including every preprocessor / build-config branch) verifying no old-form call compiles under the new signature. The lang addendum (`lang-<lang>.md`) lists the language's actual conversion semantics; plan against those.
- **`public-doc-durability`** — If the change touches `README.md` or `docs/**/*.md`, plan the denylist sweep up front (local paths, version literals, roadmap/changelog prose, session-log narrative, file-tree dumps). Use `file-pubdoc` for fresh writes.
- **`public-api-surface`** — If the change touches the public API surface (`pub` items in a public crate, equivalent in other languages), plan the surface diff baseline now (e.g., `cargo public-api` snapshot). For parallel implementations (Dense / BSp, sync / async, ...), plan a symmetry check across the public surfaces. Avoid creating asymmetric public surfaces that force consumers into expert-level internals.
