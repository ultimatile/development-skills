# Create a PR and wait for the auto-triggered CodeRabbit review.
#
# CodeRabbit is app-driven: once the GitHub app is installed on the
# repository, a review starts automatically on PR open and an
# incremental review starts on every push. There is no reviewer-request
# step, so every mode below resolves to "wait for a CodeRabbit review
# of the PR's current head commit".
#
# Completion is detected via CodeRabbit's review lifecycle signal on the
# PR's current head SHA (Review queued / in progress -> Review completed).
# That signal lands on one of two GitHub surfaces depending on the
# installation: the `CodeRabbit` commit status (Statuses API), or, on
# installs that post no commit status, the `CodeRabbit / Review` check run
# (Checks API). classify_completion() reads whichever is present. A clean
# review posts NO review object, so review presence cannot be the
# completion signal. When a review object does exist it is matched to
# the head commit by commit_id, so a review that arrived between the
# push and this script's start still counts, and stale reviews of
# earlier commits are never reported.
#
# Modes:
#   Normal:     all arguments forwarded to `gh-post pr create`
#   Poll:       --poll <PR_URL> — wait for a review of the current head
#   Re-review:  --re-review <PR_URL> — for fix loops: the push that
#               preceded this call already triggered the incremental
#               review; this waits for it (same wait as --poll)
#
# Body must flow through `--body-file <path>` or `--body-stdin`; the
# `gh-post` wrapper rejects inline `--body <string>` / `-b` so every
# body passes the hardwrap validator stack before reaching GitHub.
#
# Usage:
#   ./pr-with-coderabbit-review.sh --title "fix: foo" --body-file /tmp/body.md --base main
#   ./pr-with-coderabbit-review.sh --poll https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
#   ./pr-with-coderabbit-review.sh --re-review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
#
# Environment variables:
#   CODERABBIT_POLL_INITIAL   Initial poll interval in seconds (default: 60)
#   CODERABBIT_POLL_MAX       Max poll interval in seconds     (default: 300)
#   CODERABBIT_POLL_ATTEMPTS  Max number of poll attempts      (default: 10)
#
# `set -euo pipefail` is deferred to the direct-execution guard at the bottom so
# this file can be sourced (by the contract test) for its function definitions
# without imposing strict mode on the caller's shell.

# REST endpoints report the app's login with the `[bot]` suffix.

# Detect whether CodeRabbit SKIPPED the review instead of running it.
#
# A terminal `success` "Review completed" status with no review object is
# ambiguous: it is either a genuine zero-finding pass or a NON-REVIEW skip that
# still emits terminal success. Three skip causes are known, each leaving a
# discriminator in CodeRabbit's bot issue comments:
#
#   paused        auto-pause (`auto_pause_after_reviewed_commits` stops reviewing
#                 after N commits) — HTML marker `review paused by coderabbit.ai`.
#   rate-limited  the per-developer PR review limit was reached, so the review
#                 never started — HTML marker `rate limited by coderabbit.ai`.
#   file-limit    the diff exceeds the max-files-per-review cap, so the review was
#                 skipped to avoid a low-quality review — matched on the machine
#                 prose `skipped due to max files limit` co-occurring with the
#                 `skip review by coderabbit.ai` marker. CodeRabbit reuses that
#                 marker for this AND for intentional config skips (title patterns,
#                 drafts, path filters), so the marker alone cannot single out an
#                 unintended file-count skip; the prose alone would self-trigger on
#                 a bot walkthrough that merely quotes the phrase (this repo ships
#                 that exact sentence). Requiring BOTH — the marker scopes the match
#                 to a real skip comment, the prose selects the file-count kind —
#                 brings this check to the same anchoring the other two get from the
#                 `<!--` wrapper. Deliberate config skips (marker without the
#                 file-count prose) are intentionally NOT flagged — an intentional
#                 skip is not a false clean pass. Residual gap: CodeRabbit controls
#                 the prose and could reword it, which would slip through as a false
#                 clean pass; no stable file-count marker exists to close that.
#
# The marker checks require the `<!--` wrapper so bot walkthrough prose that merely
# describes the feature does not self-trigger (CodeRabbit's own walkthrough of a PR
# touching this code echoes words like "reviews paused"). This gate runs only
# before declaring a zero-finding pass, so a skipped (unreviewed) push is never
# reported as clean.
#
# Echoes the cause token on the first match. Returns: 0 = skip signature found
# (token on stdout), 1 = fetched but none found, 2 = fetch failed.
